# Research interests:
**_Antimicrobial resistance (AMR)_**, using `microbial genomic` approaches to define their epidemiology 
and _multidrug resistance_ risks of target bacterial pathogens, especially the `ESKAPE` pathogens, as they are 
recognised by the World Health Organization as the leading cause of infection in humans and animals, and they are
prone to Antibiotic resistance [Read about antibiotics](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK535443/). 
I am also very interested in using naturally derived bacteriophages [Phage Therapy: How it works](https://youtu.be/DeRk3BiqwtU) to provide novel solutions to combat
`antibiotic resistance`. My Master's project focuses on isolating **candidate _**lytic**_ bacteriophages**
against multidrug-resistant _Enterococcus faecalis_ ![Gram stain under microscope of E. faecalis](https://www.bing.com/images/search?view=detailV2&ccid=5p9Lg8BC&id=8FF159280D30B70CF82BBE28553CB351B9A57FAD&thid=OIP.5p9Lg8BCyhY5uLRPA7VsOwAAAA&mediaurl=https%3a%2f%2fth.bing.com%2fth%2fid%2fR.e69f4b83c042ca1639b8b44f03b56c3b%3frik%3drX%252bluVGzPFUovg%26riu%3dhttp%253a%252f%252fwww.mrsa-today.com%252fwp-content%252fuploads%252f2014%252f03%252fE-faecalis-3.jpg%26ehk%3dZCAQIbJ8YnrUYd%252bNdxZAYq3tzHlHYo5oPVNNBEpv9G4%253d%26risl%3d%26pid%3dImgRaw%26r%3d0%26sres%3d1%26sresct%3d1%26srh%3d800%26srw%3d800&exph=400&expw=400&q=enterococcus+faecalis&simid=608049455645274311&FORM=IRPRST&ck=299C47AD5870A65C09CDC5791E83CC4F&selectedIndex=30) and _Enterococcus faecium_ from environmental sources in Kenya.
> **[!IMPORTANT]** It is noteworthy to highlight that no one has ever done this phage work in Kenya; this is one of my motivations for isolating phages against
these two pathogens. 
You can find more information about Enterococcus infections [Here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK567759/)
